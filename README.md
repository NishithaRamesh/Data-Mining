**Built a supervised model to cross-sell personal loan**

The objective of this exercise was to build a model using a supervised learning technique to figure out profitable segments to target for cross-selling personal loans. Pilot campaign data of 20000 customers was used which included several demographic and behavioural variables. The Model was further validated and a deployment strategy was recommended.
